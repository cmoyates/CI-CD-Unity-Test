# CI/CD Unity Test

This repo is just a little test for me to try and figure out how to use GitHub actions and GitHub pages with Unity projects.

What it ended up doing was taking the project files from the repo, building the game (in WebGL), and deploying it to GitHub pages using a second branch all automatically!

You can check out the game itself [here](https://cmoyates.github.io/CI-CD-Unity-Test/) although it's not actually much of a game...
